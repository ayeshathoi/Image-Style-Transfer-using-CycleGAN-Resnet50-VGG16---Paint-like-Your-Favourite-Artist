## **`Paint-like-Your-Favourite-Artist  : Image-Style-Transfer-using-CycleGAN-Resnet50-VGG16`**

### Description 
Style Transfer is a technique in computer vision and graphics that involves generating a new image by combining the content of one image with the style of another image. The goal of style transfer is to create an image that preserves the content of the original image while applying the visual style of another image. Any image can be turned into a painting drawn by any artist, using one of his/her painting to transfer the style into the picture. We explored neural style transfer models VGG16 and Resnet-50, and GAN Models (Cycle GAN) to produce painting.
